## Introduction
This is a system in which everyone can fill in their jobs done for the student organization. The system automatically calculates and transfers credits to be used to compensate users products tab. The system will also have a leaderboard which ranks the three most active board members/officers by their jobs done. Most credits will win after the year and will be rewarded. 

My vision is to continuously encourage board and officers to voluenteer their time for easy jobs that benefit the greater good and help with the workload of event organizers.
